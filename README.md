# AgentMail

Hey guys, this is Galen. This is a little portfolio project that I built to assist myself in my daily life. This handles emails through a priority system, making replying easy. The goal is to use an AI agent to make part of my daily life a little easier.

(Emails are blocked out since I'd rather not leak my whole inbox to the general public)

## APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC USE, MESSAGE ME @ gtopper@stanford.edu if you want access

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>

For Gmail, you'll need to:

3. Generate an App Password (not your regular password)
4. Use the App Password in your `.env` file
